# Freemium Terminal Game

## Description

I have created a command line game that leverages user choices and decisions to navigate through your terminal.  The game utilizing some of the concepts that I have learned in
Python to bring together a story that take the user through twist and turns to try to complete the game.  The game has random references that will sometimes make the user laugh through 
their journey in this game.  My intention with making this game is to display some skills I have learned up to the point of making this game! I hope you enjoy it!

# Zoodex database project

## Description

The goal for this application was to make an application that uses get and post routes utilizing postman and ElephantSQL to create a two tables in a database for animals.  The tables that I created were for enclosures that included the type of environment the animals would be included in.  I also created a test application that will allow me to make sure that the information that I have built in the database is what I expect it to be.  I wanted to use this database to show route testing is being done correctly.

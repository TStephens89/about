# Freemium Terminal Game

## Description
I have created a command line game that leverages user choices and decisions to navigate through your terminal.  The game utilizing some of the concepts that I have learned in
Python to bring together a story that take the user through twist and turns to try to complete the game.  The game has random references that will sometimes make the user laugh through 
their journey in this game.  My intention with making this game is to display some skills I have learned up to the point of making this game! I hope you enjoy it!

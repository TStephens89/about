# Zoodex database project

## Description

The goal for this application was to make an application that uses get and post routes utilizing postman and ElephantSQL to create a two tables in a database for animals.  The tables that I created were for enclosures that included the type of environment the animals would be included in.  I also created a test application that will allow me to make sure that the information that I have built in the database is what I expect it to be.  I wanted to use this database to show route testing is being done correctly.
